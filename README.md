# Naoqi Driver

A partially updated version of [Naoqi's Driver](https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_bridge/tree/master/naoqi_driver_py) needed for Naoqi's Pose Manager ROS node 
(partially updated version of pose manager found [here](https://github.com/alyssarusk/naoqi-pose)).

Some errors have been corrected but there are still errors that need to be fixed.
